//! Per-attempt routing telemetry shared by the Model-Group dispatch
//! endpoints (#655).
//!
//! Each upstream attempt — the initial try, a same-target retry, or a
//! fallback to a different target — becomes its own `UsageEvent`. Failed
//! attempts carry zero tokens + error info; the winning attempt carries
//! the real tokens/cost. All attempts of one request share `request_id`
//! (the trace/group key) and are ordered by `index` — each attempt
//! is its own per-call log event.
//!
//! The type lives in its own module so `/v1/chat/completions`,
//! `/v1/messages`, and `/v1/responses` cannot drift apart on how they
//! classify and emit attempts.
