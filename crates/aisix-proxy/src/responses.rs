//! `POST /v1/responses` — OpenAI Responses API pass-through.
//!
//! The Responses API is an OpenAI-specific endpoint that lets callers
//! interact with the stateful responses surface (`gpt-4o` + tools). The
//! gateway proxies it transparently:
//!
//! 1. Authenticate and authorise the API key + model.
//! 2. Validate the model is an OpenAI provider.
//! 3. Rewrite the `model` field to the upstream model name.
//! 4. Forward verbatim — streaming SSE and non-streaming JSON both work.
//!
//! Only OpenAI models support this endpoint. Non-OpenAI models receive a
//! 400 with an explanatory message.
