//! Per-virtual-model routing state + target selection.
//!
//! When a request lands on a Model with `routing` configured, the proxy
//! asks the [`RoutingRegistry`] for an iterator of underlying target
//! Model names in attempt-order. The registry owns the per-virtual-
//! model state (round-robin counter, weighted PRNG seed); selection
//! itself is pure given that state.
//!
//! Positional strategies (spec §3.5) pick a starting target, then walk
//! forward on failure:
//! - **failover**: always start at `targets[0]`, walk forward on failure.
//! - **round_robin**: each *new* request advances a per-model counter
//!   so callers spread evenly across targets.
//! - **weighted**: pick a starting target with probability proportional
//!   to `weight`, then walk forward on failure (weights only affect the
//!   *first* target choice — once we're falling back, order is positional).
//!
//! Metric-ordered strategies rank the whole target set by a runtime signal
//! (attempted best-first, then falling forward). They can't be ordered from
//! `pick_targets` because the ranking key lives on the resolved target
//! Models / runtime state, so `resolve_attempt_models` ranks them instead:
//! - **least_cost**: cheapest target first, by combined input+output per-1K
//!   price; targets without a `cost` rank last.
//! - **least_latency**: fastest target first, by an EWMA of observed upstream
//!   latency; targets with no samples yet rank first (probe, then exploit).
//! - **least_busy**: least-loaded target first, by in-flight request count.
