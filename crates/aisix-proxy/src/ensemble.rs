//! Ensemble executor — fan a chat request out to a panel of models in
//! parallel, then synthesize one answer via a judge model.
//!
//! This module is the pure orchestration core. It is parameterized over a
//! [`ModelCaller`] so the fan-out / min-responses / synthesis logic is
//! unit-testable without real bridges or a network. The proxy dispatch
//! layer (`chat.rs`) supplies the production caller that resolves a model
//! `display_name` to its Bridge + ProviderKey and emits per-sub-call usage.
//!
//! Shape of one ensemble request:
//! 1. Build a per-member [`ChatFormat`] (the member's `temperature`/`seed`
//!    override the request's, which is what makes self-ensemble produce
//!    diverse answers) and dispatch every member concurrently.
//! 2. Keep the successful responses; require at least
//!    [`EnsembleConfig::min_responses_or_default`] of them, else error.
//! 3. Ask the judge model to synthesize a single answer from the labeled
//!    candidate answers, at a fixed low temperature.
//!
//! Retrying a transient sub-call failure — panel member or judge alike — is
//! the [`ModelCaller`]'s job, using that member model's own retry budget.

Your job: produce the single best possible answer to the user's ORIGINAL request.

Use the candidates as evidence, not as text to copy:
- Identify where they agree — treat consensus as likely reliable.
- Identify where they contradict — resolve it by reasoning about which is correct and why; do not just take the majority.
- Keep unique, correct, well-supported insights that only one candidate raised.
- Discard claims that are unsupported, internally inconsistent, or look hallucinated, even if several candidates share them.

Output rules (strict):
- Respond ONLY with the final answer to the user's request — no meta-commentary.
- Do NOT mention that multiple models, candidates, or a panel were involved.
- Do NOT name or attribute any candidate (\"Answer 1 says...\", model names, etc.).
- Write in the SAME language as the user's original request.
- Match the format the user asked for (code, list, prose, length).

User's original request:
{original_request}

Candidate answers:
{labeled_candidates}";
