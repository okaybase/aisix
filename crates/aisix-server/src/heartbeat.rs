//! Periodic `POST /dp/heartbeat` so cp-api knows the DP is alive.
//!
//! Protocol (prd-09a §9A.7.2 + §9A.10A.3): the DP authenticates via
//! its mTLS client certificate. cp-api reads the peer cert SAN URI
//! (`x-aisix://env/<env_id>/dp/<dp_id>`) to derive the *credential*
//! identity — there is no `Authorization` header on the v3 wire. The
//! body still carries `{ dp_id, uptime_seconds, version }` for
//! diagnostics and to keep parity with the legacy log shape.
//!
//! The cert's `dp_id` is a credential, not a runtime identity: every
//! replica deployed from the same bundle (k8s Deployment mounting one
//! Secret) presents the same `dp_id`. So each process additionally
//! reports a per-boot `instance_id` (UUID v4) plus its `hostname`,
//! letting cp-api track replicas individually instead of collapsing
//! them into one last-writer-wins row (#592).
//!
//! Shape:
//!   - spawned once from `main` after registration / bundle-on-disk
//!     load is complete
//!   - ticks at the interval returned by the register response
//!     (default 15s)
//!   - individual heartbeats fail fast on network errors; the ticker
//!     keeps running so a transient outage doesn't stop the DP from
//!     being seen when the CP comes back
//!   - cancelled via the shared `watch::Receiver<bool>` so graceful
//!     shutdown doesn't leave an in-flight request dangling
