//! Prometheus metrics registry shared across the proxy middleware and
//! the admin `/metrics` endpoint.
//!
//! Existing compatibility series cover spec §7:
//! - `aisix_requests_total{provider,model,status,outcome}` — counter
//!   incremented at the end of every proxy request.
//! - `aisix_request_duration_seconds{provider,model,status}` — histogram
//!   of end-to-end proxy latency.
//! - `aisix_ratelimit_rejections_total{scope}` — counter for 429 flows.
//! - `aisix_tokens_consumed_total{provider,model}` — counter of
//!   `usage.total_tokens` summed across completed non-streaming calls.
//!
//! Newer AISIX-native series use `aisix_proxy_*` and `aisix_llm_*`
//! names with bounded, DP-stable labels. They intentionally do not
//! copy label names from other LLM gateways that the data plane does
//! not have.
//!
//! A single [`Metrics`] instance is held `Arc`'d inside `ObsState` and
//! cloned into axum state. The exposition format is emitted via
//! `metrics-exporter-prometheus`'s text renderer; no global recorder is
//! installed, so tests can spin up isolated instances per case.
