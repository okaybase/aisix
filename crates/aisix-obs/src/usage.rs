//! Per-request usage events the proxy emits at end-of-request.
//!
//! The wire shape mirrors cp-api's `dpmgr_usage_events` table 1:1 —
//! see `aisix-cloud:internal/dpmgr/api/telemetry.go` and
//! `migrations/009_dpmgr_usage_events.up.sql` for the receiving end.
//!
//! Lifecycle:
//!
//! ```text
//! chat_completions handler --emit()--> [ mpsc::channel ] --drain--> sender worker --POST--> /dp/telemetry
//!         (proxy crate)                                                 (server crate)              (cp-api)
//! ```
//!
//! Why split sink + worker:
//!
//! - The PROXY crate (which calls `emit()` from request handlers) only
//!   needs a cheap clonable handle. It can't depend on the SERVER crate
//!   without creating a cycle (server already depends on proxy).
//! - The SERVER crate owns the worker because telemetry batching, the
//!   mTLS reqwest client, and graceful-shutdown wiring naturally live
//!   alongside cert-bundle provisioning and `heartbeat::spawn`.
//! - This module sits in `aisix-obs` (proxy already depends on it for
//!   metrics + access_log + otlp_http_sink), exposes the data type and
//!   the sink wrapper, and lets server-side wire up the consumer.
//!
//! See prd-09a §9A.7B Phase 1 for the upstream protocol; the DP-side
//! batch contract (5s interval / 100-event ceiling) lives in the worker
//! (aisix-server), not here.
